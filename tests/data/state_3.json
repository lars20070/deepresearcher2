      "content": "\nFrom Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia Earthy smell when rain falls on dry soil For other uses, see Petrichor (disambiguation) . \"Scent of rain\" and \"Smell of rain\" redirect here. For other uses, see Scent of Rain (disambiguation) and Smell of Rain (disambiguation) . Soil and water being splashed by a raindrop Petrichor ( / ˈ p ɛ t r ɪ k ɔːr / PET -rih-kor ) [ 1 ] is the earthy scent produced when rain falls on dry soil . The word was coined by Isabel Joy Bear and Richard Grenfell Thomas [ 2 ] from Ancient Greek πέτρα ( pétra ) ' rock ' or πέτρος ( pétros ) ' stone ' and ἰχώρ ( ikhṓr ) , the ethereal fluid that is the blood of the gods in Greek mythology . Origins [ edit ] A brief note on the phenomenon by Thomas Lambe Phipson [ fr ] (1833–1908) appeared in The Chemical News on 17 April 1891 [ 3 ] and was re-published in its entirety, a month later, in The Scientific American , [ 4 ] in which he wrote, \"This subject, with which I was occupied more than twenty-five years ago, appears from a paragraph in the last number of the Chemical News [ 3 ] to have recently attracted the attention of Professor Berthelot and [Monsieur G.] Andre.\" Phipson was referring to a short paper read by Berthelot and André at the meeting of the French Académie des Sciences on 23 April 1891, and printed in Volume 112 (1891) of Comptes Rendus , entitled \"Sur l'odeur propre de la terre\" (\"On the earth's own smell\"). [ 5 ] [ 6 ] Phipson continues, \"I find, on referring to my old notes, which are dated 1865, that it is doubtful whether I ever published the results of  these observations; and as the  distinguished chemists I have just named have not quite solved the problem, I hasten to give the results I obtained so long ago.\" He then theorizes that the odour \"... was due to the presence of organic substances closely related to the essential oils of plants ...\" and that these substances consist of \"... the fragrance emitted by thousands of  flowers ...\" absorbed into the pores of the soil, and only released when displaced by rain. After attempts to isolate it, he found that it \"... appeared to be very similar to, if not identical with, bromo-cedren derived from essence of cedar .\" The phenomenon was first scientifically described in a March 1964 paper by Australian researchers Isabel Bear and Dick Thomas , published in the journal Nature . [ 7 ] [ 8 ] [ 9 ] [ 10 ] Thomas coined the term \"petrichor\" to refer to what had previously been known as \"argillaceous odour\". [ 11 ] In the article, the authors describe how the smell derives from an oil exuded by certain plants during dry periods, whereupon it is absorbed by clay -based soils and rocks. During rain, the oil is released into the air along with another compound, geosmin , a metabolic by-product of certain actinobacteria , such as Streptomyces , [ 12 ] which is emitted by wet soil, producing the distinctive scent; ozone may also be present if there is lightning. [ 13 ] In a follow-up paper, Bear and Thomas (1965) showed that the oil slows seed germination and early plant growth. [ 14 ] Mechanism [ edit ] A leaf with droplets on damp soil When a raindrop lands on a porous surface, air from the pores forms small bubbles, which float to the surface and release aerosols . [ 15 ] Such aerosols carry the scent, as well as bacteria and viruses from the soil. [ 15 ] Raindrops that move slower tend to produce more aerosols; this explains why petrichor is more common after light rains. Members of the Actinomycetes , gram-positive bacteria, are responsible for producing these aerosols. [ 15 ] [ 12 ] The human nose is sensitive to geosmin and can detect it at concentrations as low as 0.4 parts per billion. [ 16 ] Some scientists believe that humans appreciate the rain scent because ancestors may have relied on rainy weather for survival. [ 17 ] Camels in the desert also rely on petrichor to locate sources of water such as oases .

      "summary": "Petrichor refers to the earthy scent produced when rain falls on dry soil or ground, often experienced as a pleasant smell. It is characterized by its distinct aroma, which is typically associated with the smell of rain on dry earth. The term was coined in 1964 by two Australian researchers, who discovered that the smell was caused by oils released from plants and soil during rainfall. These oils can come from roots, leaves, and other organic matter, and are carried into the air by the rain, creating a distinctive and often refreshing scent. Petrichor is not only a fascinating natural phenomenon but also has cultural and historical significance, with many people around the world associating it with feelings of calmness and serenity. Furthermore, petrichor has been a subject of interest in fields such as geology, biology, and psychology, where researchers study its composition, effects on human behavior, and role in shaping our perceptions of natural environments. The study of petrichor also involves understanding the complex interactions between soil, plants, and microorganisms, which contribute to the production of this unique scent. In addition, petrichor has been used as a term in literature and poetry to describe the smell of rain on dry earth, evoking feelings of nostalgia and wonder. Overall, petrichor is a captivating topic that continues to inspire scientific investigation, cultural appreciation, and personal reflection, offering insights into the intricate relationships between our environment, our senses, and our emotional experiences. The significance of petrichor extends beyond its definition as a scent, representing a connection to nature, a symbol of renewal, and a reminder of the beauty and complexity of the world around us. As research on petrichor progresses, it is likely that new discoveries will be made, shedding more light on this intriguing phenomenon and its place in our understanding of the natural world. Petrichor's impact on human experience is also an area of ongoing study, with potential applications in fields such as environmental psychology, conservation, and sustainable development. By exploring the many facets of petrichor, we can gain a deeper appreciation for the interconnectedness of our planet and the importance of preserving its natural wonders for future generations. In conclusion, the study of petrichor offers a unique opportunity to explore the intersections of science, culture, and personal experience, providing a rich and nuanced understanding of this captivating phenomenon and its significance in our lives.",
