Origins [ edit ] A brief note on the phenomenon by Thomas Lambe Phipson [ fr ] (1833–1908) appeared in The Chemical News on 17 April 1891 [ 3 ] and was re-published in its entirety, a month later, in The Scientific American , [ 4 ] in which he wrote, \"This subject, with which I was occupied more than twenty-five years ago, appears from a paragraph in the last number of the Chemical News [ 3 ] to have recently attracted the attention of Professor Berthelot and [Monsieur G.] Andre.\" Phipson was referring to a short paper read by Berthelot and André at the meeting of the French Académie des Sciences on 23 April 1891, and printed in Volume 112 (1891) of Comptes Rendus , entitled \"Sur l'odeur propre de la terre\" (\"On the earth's own smell\"). [ 5 ] [ 6 ] Phipson continues, \"I find, on referring to my old notes, which are dated 1865, that it is doubtful whether I ever published the results of  these observations; and as the  distinguished chemists I have just named have not quite solved the problem, I hasten to give the results I obtained so long ago.\" He then theorizes that the odour \"... was due to the presence of organic substances closely related to the essential oils of plants ...\" and that these substances consist of \"... the fragrance emitted by thousands of  flowers ...\" absorbed into the pores of the soil, and only released when displaced by rain. After attempts to isolate it, he found that it \"... appeared to be very similar to, if not identical with, bromo-cedren derived from essence of cedar .\" The phenomenon was first scientifically described in a March 1964 paper by Australian researchers Isabel Bear and Dick Thomas , published in the journal Nature . [ 7 ] [ 8 ] [ 9 ] [ 10 ] Thomas coined the term \"petrichor\" to refer to what had previously been known as \"argillaceous odour\". [ 11 ] In the article, the authors describe how the smell derives from an oil exuded by certain plants during dry periods, whereupon it is absorbed by clay -based soils and rocks. During rain, the oil is released into the air along with another compound, geosmin , a metabolic by-product of certain actinobacteria , such as Streptomyces , [ 12 ] which is emitted by wet soil, producing the distinctive scent; ozone may also be present if there is lightning. [ 13 ] In a follow-up paper, Bear and Thomas (1965) showed that the oil slows seed germination and early plant growth. [ 14 ] Mechanism [ edit ] A leaf with droplets on damp soil When a raindrop lands on a porous surface, air from the pores forms small bubbles, which float to the surface and release aerosols . [ 15 ] Such aerosols carry the scent, as well as bacteria and viruses from the soil. [ 15 ] Raindrops that move slower tend to produce more aerosols; this explains why petrichor is more common after light rains. Members of the Actinomycetes , gram-positive bacteria, are responsible for producing these aerosols. [ 15 ] [ 12 ] The human nose is sensitive to geosmin and can detect it at concentrations as low as 0.4 parts per billion. [ 16 ] Some scientists believe that humans appreciate the rain scent because ancestors may have relied on rainy weather for survival. [ 17 ] Camels in the desert also rely on petrichor to locate sources of water such as oases .

      "content": "Home » Science Notes Posts » Weather » Petrichor and Geosmin – The Smell of Rain Petrichor is the smell of rain. It consists of geosmin from blue-green algae and bacteria, ozone from lightning, and volatile oils from plants. Petrichor is the smell of rain when it falls on dry ground. The aroma comes from a mixture of chemicals, including geosmin from algae and bacteria, ozone from the effect of lightning on air , and volatile oils released by plants. What Is Petrichor? The term “petrichor” comes from the Greek words petra (stone) and ichor (the ethereal blood of the gods). Australian scientists Isabel Joy Bear and Richard G. Thomas introduced the word in their 1964 Nature article to describe the unique, earthy scent experienced when rain falls on dry soil. Prior to this, scientists referred to the scent as “argillaceous odour”. Chemical analysis of air during rain show it contains three groups of chemicals that are not normally present: geosmin, ozone, and certain plant oils. Lightning produces ozone well in advance of a thunderstorm, so its scent often precedes rain. When raindrops fall, their impact disturbs geosmin and plant oils on rocks and soil. The water also traps tiny air bubbles that travel upwards through the raindrop and burst out in a fizz of aerosols, spreading the petrichor scent. Geosmin Geosmin is the primary compound responsible for the smell of rain. The word stems from the Greek words geo (earth) and osme (smell). Geosmin is a bicyclic alcohol produced by certain blue-green algae (cyanobacteria) and bacteria (mainly Actinomyces, such as Streptomyces ). The compound has an earthy, musty, or muddy scent. Humans are highly sensitive to smelling or tasting geosmin. Its odor is detectable at levels as low as 5 parts per trillion. Many animals also smell geosmin. For example, camels use the odor for finding water in deserts. Cyanobacteria and bacteria that produce geosmin release it when they die. When rain falls, it disrupts the surface and spreads geosmin into air, contributing its part to the petrichor scent. While most people find the aroma of geosmin pleasant in rain, it also has a flavor. It is the molecule that gives beets and some wines their earthy flavor. However, it also gives water and fish (especially freshwater fish) a muddy or musty taste. Water treatment plants often take steps to remove geosmin from drinking water, typically using activated carbon or advanced oxidation. Fish farms purge the flavor by housing fish in clean water prior to harvesting. Adding lemon, vinegar, or another acid to a fish recipe breaks down the compound so that the dish tastes better. Ozone in Petrichor Lightning is the main source of the ozone scent of a thunderstorm. The energy of a lightning strike breaks the chemical bonds that hold nitrogen (N 2 ) and oxygen (O 2 ) molecules together. Some of the oxygen molecules combine and form ozone (O 3 ). While a small amount of ozone in air smells like rain, too much is unhealthy and causes health effects, such as worsening asthma. Volatile Plant Oils in Petrichor Plants release oils during dry spells that protect them from loosing too much water and also deposit on the ground and prevent seed germination. This minimizes the chance of seedlings sprouting and then dying from lack of moisture. When rain falls, these oils splash up and enter the air, adding another earthy component to petrichor. The principal oils are stearic acid and palmitic acid. Both of these oils are nearly odorless, but they have a slight waxy, soapy aroma. References Anderson, W.; G.J. Prescott; S. Packham; J.

Humans are highly sensitive to smelling or tasting geosmin. Its odor is detectable at levels as low as 5 parts per trillion. Many animals also smell geosmin. For example, camels use the odor for finding water in deserts. Cyanobacteria and bacteria that produce geosmin release it when they die. When rain falls, it disrupts the surface and spreads geosmin into air, contributing its part to the petrichor scent. While most people find the aroma of geosmin pleasant in rain, it also has a flavor. It is the molecule that gives beets and some wines their earthy flavor. However, it also gives water and fish (especially freshwater fish) a muddy or musty taste. Water treatment plants often take steps to remove geosmin from drinking water, typically using activated carbon or advanced oxidation. Fish farms purge the flavor by housing fish in clean water prior to harvesting. Adding lemon, vinegar, or another acid to a fish recipe breaks down the compound so that the dish tastes better. Ozone in Petrichor Lightning is the main source of the ozone scent of a thunderstorm. The energy of a lightning strike breaks the chemical bonds that hold nitrogen (N 2 ) and oxygen (O 2 ) molecules together. Some of the oxygen molecules combine and form ozone (O 3 ). While a small amount of ozone in air smells like rain, too much is unhealthy and causes health effects, such as worsening asthma. Volatile Plant Oils in Petrichor Plants release oils during dry spells that protect them from loosing too much water and also deposit on the ground and prevent seed germination. This minimizes the chance of seedlings sprouting and then dying from lack of moisture. When rain falls, these oils splash up and enter the air, adding another earthy component to petrichor. The principal oils are stearic acid and palmitic acid. Both of these oils are nearly odorless, but they have a slight waxy, soapy aroma. References Anderson, W.; G.J. Prescott; S. Packham; J.

It consists of geosmin from blue-green algae and bacteria, ozone from lightning, and volatile oils from plants. Petrichor is the smell of rain when it falls on dry ground. The aroma comes from a mixture of chemicals, including geosmin from algae and bacteria, ozone from the effect of lightning on air , and volatile oils released by plants. What Is Petrichor? The term “petrichor” comes from the Greek words petra (stone) and ichor (the ethereal blood of the gods). Australian scientists Isabel Joy Bear and Richard G. Thomas introduced the word in their 1964 Nature article to describe the unique, earthy scent experienced when rain falls on dry soil. Prior to this, scientists referred to the scent as “argillaceous odour”. Chemical analysis of air during rain show it contains three groups of chemicals that are not normally present: geosmin, ozone, and certain plant oils. Lightning produces ozone well in advance of a thunderstorm, so its scent often precedes rain. When raindrops fall, their impact disturbs geosmin and plant oils on rocks and soil. The water also traps tiny air bubbles that travel upwards through the raindrop and burst out in a fizz of aerosols, spreading the petrichor scent.
