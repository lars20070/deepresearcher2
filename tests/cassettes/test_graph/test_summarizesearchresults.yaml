      k \u0254\u02D0r / PET -rih-kor ) [ 1 ] is the earthy scent produced when rain
      falls on dry soil . The word was coined by Isabel Joy Bear and Richard Grenfell
      Thomas [ 2 ] from Ancient Greek \u03C0\u03AD\u03C4\u03C1\u03B1 ( p\xE9tra )
      ' rock ' or \u03C0\u03AD\u03C4\u03C1\u03BF\u03C2 ( p\xE9tros ) ' stone ' and
      \u1F30\u03C7\u03CE\u03C1 ( ikh\u1E53r ) , the ethereal fluid that is the blood
      of the gods in Greek mythology . Origins [ edit ] A brief note on the phenomenon
      by Thomas Lambe Phipson [ fr ] (1833\u20131908) appeared in The Chemical News
      on 17 April 1891 [ 3 ] and was re-published in its entirety, a month later,
      in The Scientific American , [ 4 ] in which he wrote, \\\"This subject, with
      which I was occupied more than twenty-five years ago, appears from a paragraph
      in the last number of the Chemical News [ 3 ] to have recently attracted the
      attention of Professor Berthelot and [Monsieur G.] Andre.\\\" Phipson was referring
      to a short paper read by Berthelot and Andr\xE9 at the meeting of the French
      Acad\xE9mie des Sciences on 23 April 1891, and printed in Volume 112 (1891)
      of Comptes Rendus , entitled \\\"Sur l'odeur propre de la terre\\\" (\\\"On
      the earth's own smell\\\"). [ 5 ] [ 6 ] Phipson continues, \\\"I find, on referring
      to my old notes, which are dated 1865, that it is doubtful whether I ever published
      the results of  these observations; and as the  distinguished chemists I have
      just named have not quite solved the problem, I hasten to give the results I
      obtained so long ago.\\\" He then theorizes that the odour \\\"... was due to
      the presence of organic substances closely related to the essential oils of
      plants ...\\\" and that these substances consist of \\\"... the fragrance emitted
      by thousands of  flowers ...\\\" absorbed into the pores of the soil, and only
      released when displaced by rain. After attempts to isolate it, he found that
      it \\\"... appeared to be very similar to, if not identical with, bromo-cedren
      derived from essence of cedar .\\\" The phenomenon was first scientifically
      described in a March 1964 paper by Australian researchers Isabel Bear and Dick
      Thomas , published in the journal Nature . [ 7 ] [ 8 ] [ 9 ] [ 10 ] Thomas coined
      the term \\\"petrichor\\\" to refer to what had previously been known as \\\"argillaceous
      odour\\\". [ 11 ] In the article, the authors describe how the smell derives
      from an oil exuded by certain plants during dry periods, whereupon it is absorbed
      by clay -based soils and rocks. During rain, the oil is released into the air
      along with another compound, geosmin , a metabolic by-product of certain actinobacteria
      , such as Streptomyces , [ 12 ] which is emitted by wet soil, producing the
      distinctive scent; ozone may also be present if there is lightning. [ 13 ] In
      a follow-up paper, Bear and Thomas (1965) showed that the oil slows seed germination
      and early plant growth. [ 14 ] Mechanism [ edit ] A leaf with droplets on damp
      soil When a raindrop lands on a porous surface, air from the pores forms small
      bubbles, which float to the surface and release aerosols . [ 15 ] Such aerosols
      carry the scent, as well as bacteria and viruses from the soil. [ 15 ] Raindrops
      that move slower tend to produce more aerosols; this explains why petrichor
      is more common after light rains. Members of the Actinomycetes , gram-positive
      bacteria, are responsible for producing these aerosols. [ 15 ] [ 12 ] The human
      nose is sensitive to geosmin and can detect it at concentrations as low as 0.4
      parts per billion. [ 16 ] Some scientists believe that humans appreciate the
      rain scent because ancestors may have relied on rainy weather for survival.
      [ 17 ] Camels in the desert also rely on petrichor to locate sources of water
      such as oases . [ 18 ] See also [ edit ] Dimethyl sulfide \u2013 One of the

        refers to the earthy scent produced when rain falls on dry soil or ground,
        a phenomenon often experienced as a pleasant smell after periods of drought
        or dry weather. The term \"petrichor\" was coined in 1964 by two Australian
        researchers, Isabel Joy Bear and R. G. Thomas, who published their findings
        in the journal Nature. They derived the word from the Greek words \"petra,\"
        meaning stone, and \"ichor,\" which refers to the ethereal fluid that flows
        through the veins of the gods in Greek mythology.\n\nThe aroma of petrichor
        is primarily attributed to the release of certain chemicals when raindrops
        hit porous surfaces like soil and rocks. One key component responsible for
        this smell is geosmin, a compound produced by actinobacteria, specifically
        Streptomyces bacteria, which are abundant in soil. Geosmin has a distinct
        earthy odor that many people find appealing. Other contributing factors include
        the breakdown of plant oils and volatile organic compounds (VOCs) released
        from leaves and other vegetation.\n\nThe process begins when raindrops strike
        the ground and displace tiny air bubbles trapped within the porous materials.
        As these bubbles rise to the surface, they burst, releasing aerosols that
        carry geosmin and other aromatic compounds into the air. The fine mist created
        by this process carries the aroma over long distances, which is why people
        can often detect petrichor before the rain actually reaches their location.\n\nPetrichor
        is not just a sensory experience; it also has cultural and emotional significance
        for many people. In literature and poetry, the smell of rain on dry earth
        is often used as a metaphor for renewal, rejuvenation, and nostalgia. The
        term has even found its way into popular culture, inspiring names for perfumes,
        fragrances, and other scented products.\n\nBeyond its aesthetic appeal, petrichor
        also plays a role in ecological processes. The release of geosmin and other
        compounds during rainfall can influence plant growth and soil health. For
        example, some studies suggest that the presence of geosmin can promote seed
        germination and root development in certain plants. This may be an evolutionary
        adaptation to ensure that seeds are more likely to grow in environments where
        water is available.\n\nThe science behind petrichor has been further explored
        through various research studies. Scientists have used advanced techniques
        such as gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) to identify and quantify
        the chemical compounds responsible for the scent. These studies have revealed
        that the composition of petrichor can vary depending on factors such as soil
        type, vegetation cover, and climate conditions.\n\nIn addition to geosmin,
        other notable compounds found in petrichor include 2-methylisoborneol (MIB),
        which has a musty odor similar to that of moldy basements, and various terpenes,
        which are aromatic organic molecules produced by plants. Terpenes contribute
        to the fresh, pine-like scent often associated with rain, particularly in
        forested areas.\n\nThe perception of petrichor can also vary among individuals.
        Some people find the smell intensely pleasant, while others may be more sensitive
        to its earthy undertones. This variability is influenced by factors such as
        personal experience, cultural background, and individual olfactory sensitivity.
        For many, the scent of rain on dry earth evokes feelings of comfort, relief,
        and a connection to nature.\n\nPetrichor has also been studied in relation
        to atmospheric processes. Researchers have found that the aerosols released
        during rainfall can affect air quality and contribute to the formation of
        secondary organic aerosols (SOAs) in the atmosphere. These aerosols play a
        role in cloud formation and can influence climate patterns over time.\n\nIn
        conclusion, petrichor is a multifaceted phenomenon that encompasses both scientific
        and cultural dimensions. It is a complex interplay of chemical reactions,
        ecological processes, and human perception. The earthy scent produced when
        rain falls on dry ground not only enriches our sensory experiences but also
        contributes to the health and resilience of ecosystems. Whether it evokes
        memories of childhood, inspires poetic reflection, or serves as a subtle indicator
        of environmental conditions, petrichor remains a captivating and enduring
        aspect of our natural world."},"finish_reason":"stop"}],"usage":{"prompt_tokens":260,"completion_tokens":846,"total_tokens":1106}}
